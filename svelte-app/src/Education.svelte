                I am an undergraduate senior at Georgia Institute of Technology, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
                While my coursework spans most areas in the field, my biggest interests are in machine learning, backend development, and 
                smaller computing units.
                I am fascinated by the idea of packaging the most innovative ml models, and deploying them into scenarios with limited computing power. 
                I am also interested in the intersection of software, and machine learning, and am currently working on a personal project to create a synthesizer in C.

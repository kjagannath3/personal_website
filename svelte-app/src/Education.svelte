                I am an undergraduate senior at Georgia Institute of Technology, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
                While my coursework spans most areas in the field, my biggest interests are in machine learning, backend development, and 
                smaller computing units.
                I am fascinated by the idea of packaging the most innovative ml models, and deploying them into scenarios with limited computing power. 
                I am also interested in the intersection of software, and machine learning, and am currently working on a personal project to create a synthesizer in C.

                I am also persuing a certificate in general music studies from the Berklee College of Music, where I will focus on music technology, digital sound processing,
                and sound design. My dream project, given unlimited resources, would be to create the ultimate digital audio workstation, with a focus on live performance. The material
                I am learning at Berklee is invaluable to this endeavor.

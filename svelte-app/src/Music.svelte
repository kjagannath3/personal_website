                When I'm not busy selling my soul to a big tech company, I'm usually doing something with music
                I am the director of Sympathetic Vibrations, Georgia Tech's premier all-male acapella group. On top 
                of our bi-annual concerts every year, we have gigs every semester. I am also extremely interested in 
                the intersection of music technology and software. Take a look below at some of my work, our lates Sympathetic Vibrations
                concerts, and everything in between.
